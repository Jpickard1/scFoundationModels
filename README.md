# scFoundationModels
This repository has demos for single cell foundation models set up on Great Lakes under the Rajapakse lab partition

## Working Models

The following models should work on Great Lakes. Their model weights have been saved to `turbo`. Brief instillation instructions for the models are linked in the respective notebooks.
